# Baby Steps: Multiplayer Mod - Client

The **Baby Steps: Multiplayer Mod** is a [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/) mod that adds **full body multiplayer presence** to the demo and full versions of *Baby Steps*.  

Cutscenes are triggered independently on each client and do not affect other players. Each player has full collisions and can bump into each other. Hats and held items are replicated.
